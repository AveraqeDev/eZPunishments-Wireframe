# eZPunishments

eZPunishments will be an admin panel application for Minecraft server owners. It will allow them to more easily manager their players and the punishments they give out as well as allowing said players to view more details about their punishment. 

Administrators will have the ability to set accounts as Staff. Once an account is staff they are able to perform more actions, such as Execute punishments, view punishment histories, view reports, close reports, and manage active punishments. 

Normal account users will have the ability to view their own punishment history and make a report. They will not be able to view other players history, or view any report they did not submit themselves.
